# Car-Hire-System
This is the coursework we have been set for object-oriented programming module at university. The aim of this code is to simulate the program used by people at a car hiring company. The users will need to do a lot of things like search for cars and track customers. I will be starting work on this in the near future and have created this repository slightly early in preparation.
